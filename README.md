# Contact-Tracing-Algorithm
Contact tracing is the name of the process used to identify those who come into contact with people who have tested positive for contagious diseases â€” such as measles, HIV, and COVID-19. During a pandemic, performing contact tracing correctly can help reduce the number of people to get infected or speed up the process of treating infected people. Doing so can help save many lives.

The technology I have used that can help this process is Machine Learning. More precisely, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), which is a type of Clustering Algorithm.
